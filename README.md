The Enhanced Portfolio webpage is designed to provide a view of my work. It includes a home section, an about me section with my interests and background, a contact me section with my contact information, a skills section, and a projects section showcasing the mini-projects I have completed through Coding Temple.
Each page is styled with its own CSS file to ensure uniqueness while also maintaining a cohesive design throughout all the sections.
